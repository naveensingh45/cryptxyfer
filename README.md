**CRYPTXFER** is a lightweight and privacy-first file encryption and sharing tool built for individuals who value **data control**, **security**, and **simplicity**. Whether you're transferring sensitive documents, personal media, or project files — CRYPTXFER ensures they stay **encrypted**, **private**, and **only accessible with your passphrase**.

---

## Features

- **AES encryption**: High-grade symmetric encryption with integrity checks
- **Passphrase protected**: Only the correct phrase can decrypt your files
- **Web-based interface**: Upload, download, and decrypt via browser
- **Universal file support**: Upload and encrypt any file type
- **Self-hosted**: Run locally, no dependency on third-party cloud
- **Stateless design**: Passphrases and keys never leave your machine

---

## How It Works

- Files are encrypted using **AES** before upload.
- Encrypted files are stored in the `encrypted_files/` directory.
- Users must enter the same passphrase to decrypt and access the files.
- The app can directly stream audio from encrypted `.mp3` files.
